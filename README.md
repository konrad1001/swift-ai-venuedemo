# Apple Intelligence Venue Management Demo

This simple sample project looks at alternative integrations with the assistant AppIntents framework. As of yet, the Apple provided Assistant Schemas are still very limited in what they can do, and provided schemas are not very flexible for a wide range of apps. Making use of non assisted intents and entities is still very useful for Siri and Spotlight integration, and surely eventual AI agent support
